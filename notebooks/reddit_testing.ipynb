I made this mistake myself and I find that it is not often talked about online.\\xa0\\n\\nIn short: if you have a small bag (less than 50k) and you are looking to invest. IMO, don't.\\n\\nUse that money and build something. The return on building a small business, a product, a freelancing company, learning a skill, taking a class, etc. will always be a far better ROI.\\n\\nLet me explain with some numbers that were my own. At the age of 20, I had about $10,000 USD to invest. I researched and managed a return of 13%. This sounds good, but it was mostly luck. And even if it weren't it's still not enough.\\xa0\\n\\nLet's extrapolate and say that I do this every year for 5 years.\\xa0\\n10k * 1.13 = $11,300\\n$11,300 * 1.13 = $12,769\\n…\\nYear 5 yields a total of $18,424.35 In 5 years, I made $8,424.35\\n\\nThis is not a life changing amount of money for 5 years.\\xa0\\n\\nThe trade of 5 years for 8,400 is not enough.\\n\\nInstead, let's say I take that $10,000 and invest in myself.\\xa0\\n\\nI take a coding bootcamp for $5000, get a job paying $20,000 more than I had previously, and in 1 year, I am up $15,000. I pay my taxes, and I am still at $10,000. I had to work, but I now have a skill. Over the next 3 years, I get 3 raises. I had to work anyway. The profits from my 10,000 are not nearly enough.\\xa0\\n\\nIt's far better to work on a skill than to invest with small amounts.\\xa0\\n\\nHowever, instead let's say I have $100,000.\\xa0\\n\\nThis is quite different.\\xa0\\n\\nMy first year, I will make $13,000 in profits. Likely competitive with my annual raises at my coding job.\\xa0\\n\\nAfter 5 years, I will have made $84,000 in interest.\\xa0\\n\\nI could have even took 10k from that 100k to take more classes, invest in equipment, grow my skills, etc. and my returns will still be close to that.\\xa0\\nThe mistake I made was investing too soon. Go work really hard when you are young, invest in yourself, build. your skills, and grow a bag. Then invest when you have a chunk.\\n\\nAs a final note: if you do invest in risky crypto markets and manage to hit 100k early on, sell it all, and switch to a slower strategy. You will have just skipped 5+ years of early investing and you are set up to win. Don't mess it up by gambling it.\",\n",
